                        Your support helps cover administrative fees for those
                         that have a financial hardship so they can participate 
                         in the Be Well Parkinson's Program. With the support of our donors,
                          no one is turned away due to financial hardship. If donations 
                          received exceed amount needed to cover fees for those who request 
                          financial assistance by the end of the organization's fiscal year,
                           funds will be used for general operating purposes.
